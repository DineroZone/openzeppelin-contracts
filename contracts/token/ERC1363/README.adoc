= ERC 1363

[.readme-notice]
NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/erc1363

This set of interfaces, contracts, and utilities are all related to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363[ERC1363 Payable Token].

The EIP specifies three interfaces:

* {IERC1363}: Core functionality required in all compliant implementation.
* {IERC1363Receiver}: An interface that must be implemented by contracts if they want to accept tokens through `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall`.
* {IERC1363Spender}: An interface that must be implemented by contracts if they want to accept tokens through `approveAndCall`.

{ERC1363} implements the mandatory {IERC1363} interface.

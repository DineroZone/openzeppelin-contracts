+> You are looking at the upgradeable variant of OpenZeppelin Contracts. Be sure to review the documentation on [Using OpenZeppelin Contracts with Upgrades](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable).

 ## Overview
 
 ### Installation
 
 ```
-$ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
+$ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
 ```
 
 OpenZeppelin Contracts features a [stable API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/releases-stability#api-stability), which means that your contracts won't break unexpectedly when upgrading to a newer minor version.
 
-An alternative to npm is to use the GitHub repository (`openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts`) to retrieve the contracts. When doing this, make sure to specify the tag for a release such as `v4.5.0`, instead of using the `master` branch.

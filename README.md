## Use Cases
* Create transferable tokens (e.g. stablecoins) and NFTs using audited and battle-tested implementations of [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc20), [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc721), and [ERC1155](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc1155).
* Build DeFi protocols and manage permissions using state-of-the-art [AccessManager](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#AccessManager).
* Set up and manage on-chain [Governance]https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/governance) for a DAO.
* Dream up your own idea with reusable [Solidity components](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/utilities).

## Installation

### Hardhat (npm)
```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts 
```

### Foundry (git)
```
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

Add `@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/` in `remappings.txt` after running `forge install`

> [!NOTE]
> `forge install` uses the latest version, but subsequent `forge update` commands will use `master` branch.
>
> Always use tagged versions to ensure your code has gone through OpenZeppelin's secure release process.

### Semantic Versioning
OpenZeppelin Contracts uses semantic versioning to communicate backwards compatibility of its API and storage layout. For upgradeable contracts, the storage layout of different major versions should be assumed incompatible, for example, it is unsafe to upgrade from 4.9.3 to 5.0.0. Learn more at [Backwards Compatibility](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/backwards-compatibility) and check out our [4.x -> 5.0 migration guide](https://zpl.in/contracts/migrate-v4-to-v5).

## Usage
Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.21;

import {ERC721} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract MyCollectible is ERC721 {
    constructor() ERC721("MyCollectible", "MCO") {
    }
}
```

_If you're new to smart contract development, head to [Developing Smart Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts) to learn about creating a new project and compiling your contracts._


### Secure Code
To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use in your code are deployed, ensuring greater gas efficiency.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://www.openzeppelin.com/defender) is designed to assist throughout the secure development process. From you securing your codebase with automatic code analysis, to streamlining audit reviews, verifying deployments, and monitoring live contracts with reusable trusted templates, Defender is a full-stack solution for secure smart contract development. Read more about the Code, Audit, Deploy, Monitor, and Actions modules in the [documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/v2/).

## Security
This project is maintained by [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) with the goal of providing a secure and reliable library of smart contract components for the Solidity ecosystem. We address security through risk management in various areas such as engineering and open source [best practices](./GUIDELINES.md), scoping and API design, multi-layered review processes, and incident response preparedness.

The [OpenZeppelin Contracts Security Center](https://contracts.openzeppelin.com/security) contains more details about the secure development process, including past audits, our bug bounty program, and advanced testing methods such as fuzzing and formal verification.

Smart contracts are a nascent technology and carry a high level of technical risk and uncertainty. Although OpenZeppelin is well known for its security audits, using OpenZeppelin Contracts is not a substitute for a security audit. OpenZeppelin Contracts is made available under the MIT License, which disclaims all warranties in relation to the project and which limits the liability of those that contribute and maintain the project, including OpenZeppelin. As set out further in the Terms, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any use of OpenZeppelin Contracts and you assume all risks associated with any such use.

## Learn More
The guides in the [documentation site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts) will teach about different concepts, and how to use the related contracts that OpenZeppelin Contracts provides.

The [full API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC20) is also thoroughly documented, and serves as a great reference when developing your smart contract application. You are also welcome to ask for assistance and follow Contracts development in the [community forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com).

Finally, you may want to take a look at the [guides on our blog](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/), which cover several common use cases and best practices.
